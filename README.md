# Fraud-Detection-Model
This project presents a fraud detection system developed using machine learning models such as Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Random Forest. It analyzes and compares the performance of these models using two real-world datasets: PaySim (mobile money simulation) and Credit Card fraud detection datasets
