Fraud Detection System Using Machine Learning

This project is focused on detecting fraudulent transactions in the banking sector using machine learning algorithms. It uses two datasets PaySim and Credit Card and applies Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Random Forest models.

Datasets Used
PaySim Dataset: Simulated mobile money transactions
Credit Card Dataset: Real transaction data with anonymized features

Algorithms Used
- Decision Tree
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Random Forest

Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- Confusion Matrix
- ROC Curve

Tools & Libraries
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

 Objective
To help financial institutions detect fraudulent activities more accurately by comparing different machine learning models.

Results
Each model's performance is evaluated and compared using visualizations and metrics.
